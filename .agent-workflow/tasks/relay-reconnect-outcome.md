# Record the terminal outcome of retained reconnect recovery

<!-- agent-workflow:start -->
**Outcome:** A failed or completed retained Codex reconnect can be distinguished from retry exhaustion, uncertain registration and safety refusal through one bounded private terminal diagnostic, without changing recovery behavior.

**Target:** Pallium Codex retained MCP client.

**Scope:** app/mcp/codex_desktop_bridge.py, tests/test_codex_worker_reconnect.py, and this Work Record.

**Constraints:** Preserve caller-visible results, protocol operations and their order, finite retry/deadline budgets, registration no-replay rules, cleanup and identity/I/O fences. No raw exceptions, payloads, tokens, paths or session identifiers in the new diagnostic. No new dependencies, settings, generic observer framework, installed changes, connection recreation, service restart, synthetic traffic or changes to parked work.

**Completion criteria:** Every retained reconnect episode emits at most one truthful terminal observation with process-unique local correlation, entered/completed phase, attempt ordinal, registration-attempt status and already-computed safety flags. Diagnostic failure does not change return values, errors, native calls, retries or disposal. Caller-surface lifecycle tests exercise recovery and failure with bounded private output. Source validation and independent review identify remaining installed qualification limits.

**Risk:** Elevated

**Complexity:** Moderate

**Reason:** The runtime client file is gray and watched by Redline; observations cross exception-heavy recovery control flow. Tests and record are blue. No public API, schema, persistence or authentication behavior changes are proposed.

**Discovery:** Existing bounded close diagnostics identify READY retirement but omit the terminal reconnect phase and decision. Constructor, READY, REGISTER and safety failures can all return no replacement. Successful registration replies can also fail subsequent guards. Existing tests exercise these paths and caller-surface MCP recovery; reuse them. The current logger is rotating and failure-contained. Claim deadline exhaustion and processor contention are separate unresolved incidents; this observation does not explain their physical causes.

**Material assumptions:** Existing recovery control flow and already-computed flags suffice for truthful observations without new protocol, property or clock probes. If implementation requires reevaluating guards, changing short-circuit order or introducing new behavior, stop and return to planning. An installed client cannot emit new source diagnostics until it is recreated; rollout is excluded from this task.

**Plan:** First invoke Agent Workflow, establish this immutable baseline and classify risk before code edits. Independently review this plan. Extend only the existing private bounded diagnostic sink and recovery paths with process-unique local episode correlation and fixed terminal metadata. Mark phase entry/completion and registration attempt immediately around existing calls; distinguish explicit busy, uncertain registration, post-registration guard refusal, constructor/READY failure and true exhaustion. Include pre-reconnect refusal without duplicate terminal output. Preserve predicates and cleanup order. Extend existing recovery fixtures and at least one MCP caller-surface lifecycle journey; add privacy, sink failure and multi-worker correlation controls. Run focused tests, affected files and the whole-change validation selector; run the required non-slow suite once before result review or publication, preserving any failures. No CI rerun campaign or unrelated accommodations. Return for scoped review if source reach expands.

**Verification plan:**
- Truthful every-terminal observations and unique local correlation -> parameterized controls in tests/test_codex_worker_reconnect.py, including multiple workers and episodes.
- Unchanged native calls, retry budgets, errors and cleanup -> existing same-epoch, idle-retirement and busy-recovery assertions plus failing-sink controls.
- Caller-surface observable lifecycle and bounded private sink -> existing MCP protocol journey with real isolated diagnostic file and privacy/rotation assertions.
- Whole-change validation and independent adequacy -> scripts/test-plan.py --base origin/main, reported required checks, one required non-slow suite, import boundaries, workflow/Redline and independent result review.
- No installed recovery claim -> source-only evidence clearly separated from unperformed loaded-client rollout and installed acceptance.

**Plan review:** Pending independent technical review of this exact record; proposal review alone is not plan approval.

**Approvals:** Not required at Elevated risk. Standing user authorization covers isolated bug work; manager authorized this bounded source diagnostic. Installed changes are excluded.

**Exceptions:** —

**State:** Blocked

## Implementation

Planning only. Base is current main `9d01176483d7a353d1f88de7830a31e409c5959b`; branch `feat/relay-reconnect-outcome`. The separate expiry-detection pull request remains parked and is not part of this diff. Manager owns the shared roadmap; contribution reconciliation is pending a source result.

## Evidence

Source inspection and independent proposal assessment are complete. No new source code, tests, runtime protocol calls or installed changes have been performed for this implementation task. Private incident evidence is retained outside public artifacts.

## Result review

Pending implementation and validation. This task is observability only and does not establish recovery reliability or identify the physical claim-deadline cause.
