## Summary

Make immediate activation the default for every resolved Relay recipient while
preserving durable next-turn delivery as the automatic fallback. The sender does
not choose a delivery mode: Pallium persists first, uses the recipient runtime's
native wake mechanism when safe, and otherwise leaves the delivery pending.

## Why

Relay does not remove manual coordination if the user must prompt an idle recipient
merely to discover its mail. Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode expose different
mechanisms for starting or queuing a turn, so Pallium needs small runtime-specific
adapters behind one observable delivery contract.

## Primary Product Outcome

After one user instruction, a developer session and an architect/reviewer session
can carry a bounded implementation-review-remediation exchange through explicit
Relay messages without the user prompting either recipient to check for mail. Each
send wakes the addressed live session, enters its model-visible context exactly
once, and can receive an explicit delivery-derived reply. The user re-enters only
for a permission, product decision, unresolved failure, or requested final result.

This is the main wake validation journey, not a later demo. It does not make
Pallium a team manager: the user still starts the work, agents explicitly choose
when and whom to message, and Pallium only persists, addresses, activates, and
reports delivery. `fix-relay-claim-before-context-emission` (`RF-005`) is a release
prerequisite because both wake and fallback must be loss-safe.

## Delivery Contract

1. Persist the message and immutable per-recipient deliveries before attempting
   activation.
2. For every resolved recipient, use its advertised wake capability by default;
   there is no sender-side `wake` option.
3. If idle, start a new turn. If busy, queue a distinct turn at the runtime's safe
   boundary; never steer Relay text into an active human-owned turn.
4. Mark the delivery complete only when the runtime confirms admission into the
   recipient context. A trigger request or transport acknowledgement is not enough.
5. If activation is unsupported, disabled, unavailable, stale, or fails, leave the
   same delivery pending for the existing next-natural-turn path.

Track activation separately from the durable delivery lifecycle. Operationally,
Pallium must distinguish `queued` (persisted, not activated), `triggered` (a runtime
turn was requested), and `delivered` (the runtime admitted the message). Never call
a message read, understood, or used. Stable message and delivery IDs must make wake
retries, runtime callbacks, and hook fallback idempotent.

## Runtime Feasibility and Constraints

Deeper source review on 2026-08-26 corrected the initial Phase 0 verdict. The
installed versions are Claude Code 2.1.246, Codex CLI 0.149.1, and OpenCode
1.18.19 on native Windows.

| Runtime | Current verdict | Proven mechanism | Remaining qualification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Codex | **Passive-only; no qualifying existing-session ingress is known** | A separately launched App Server accepts `thread/queue/add`, but that controls a Pallium-owned runtime rather than the addressed Codex session. It is not a Relay wake mechanism. | Revisit only when a supported integration can target the exact already-running Codex session, preserve its identity, and prove correlated admission there. |
| OpenCode | Supported with a Pallium/OpenCode plugin coordinator | Server/plugin APIs expose stable sessions and async prompts. Agent Intercom demonstrates persist-first delivery, application metadata correlation, history verification before replay, safe busy deferral, and restart recovery. | A bare prompt_async 204 is transport acknowledgement only. Pallium needs the plugin-owned durable pending ledger and a Windows E2E proof. |
| Claude Code | Version-eligible for native live-session wake; strict busy delivery still needs a policy/proof | Official cross-session messaging starts a new turn when idle and authenticates the local inbox socket on native Windows. Installed 2.1.246 exceeds the documented 2.1.234 Windows minimum. | During an active turn Claude reads messages between tool calls, which may not create a distinct following turn. Verify native Windows delivery/correlation and either defer busy messages until idle or explicitly relax the distinct-turn invariant. |

### Admission handshakes to preserve

**Codex:** no wake handshake is selected. The managed App Server queue probe is
retained only as rejected feasibility evidence: it does not reach the exact
already-running session addressed by Relay.

**OpenCode:** the plugin persists the Relay item before broker acknowledgement,
checks recent session history for metadata.palliumRelayId, defers submission to a
safe boundary, calls the supported prompt API, and marks admission only when
session messages/events contain that exact ID. On restart it replays only items
not proven admitted. A server plugin can cover normal OpenCode sessions without
requiring every session to be launched by a Pallium wrapper.

**Claude Code:** register only a live inbox with its socket/token and current
inbound policy. Include the Pallium delivery ID in the attributed envelope and do
not equate socket acceptance with downstream use. Idle native delivery may wake
immediately. Busy delivery must not violate the separate-turn contract; use an
idle notification/deferred send if that can be proven, otherwise fall back to
next-turn Relay. Channels remain a research-preview fallback, not the preferred
local adapter.

Each live session advertises only capabilities its integration actually proves:
passive, idle_wake, and busy_queue. Missing, expired, disabled, or lost capability
selects durable fallback. Runtime names are never global capability claims, and an
exited arbitrary process is not wakeable merely because its conversation can be
resumed by launching another process.

### Next disposable PoC sequence

Test only integrations that can reach the exact existing addressed session.
Start with Claude native messaging and the OpenCode plugin path. Revisit Codex
only if a supported existing-session ingress becomes available; do not spend a
Relay implementation cycle proving a substitute Pallium-owned runtime.

## In Scope

- wake every eligible resolved recipient by default, including runtime fan-out
- allow a recipient integration to explicitly disable wake and remain passive
- persist before attempting wake; retain next-natural-turn delivery as fallback
- queue busy recipients for a separate safe turn rather than steering an active
  human-owned turn
- confirm runtime admission before marking delivery complete
- make trigger attempts idempotent so wake and fallback cannot double-deliver
- expose wake attempts, admission, fallback reasons, failures, latency, and fan-out
  in Relay operational telemetry
- implement and validate the smallest supported native adapter for Claude Code,
  Codex, and OpenCode
- cover idle, busy, concurrent user input, unsupported capability, stale or closed
  sessions, runtime and Pallium restarts, duplicate triggers, permissions, fan-out,
  expiry, and reply-loop protection through public-surface E2E tests

## Safety and Cost Boundary

Wake changes Relay from passive information transport into an execution trigger:
the receiving model can consume tokens, invoke tools, and modify files. Therefore:

- Relay input is attributed peer input with lower authority than user instructions;
  it cannot grant consent, approve permissions, change runtime configuration, or
  bypass the recipient's sandbox and approval policy
- runtime-wide fan-out still wakes every resolved recipient by default, but the
  resulting turn count, failures, and observable usage must be visible
- bounded queues, duplicate/rate limits, and a finite reply-hop policy must prevent
  accidental wake storms and autonomous reply loops
- automatic replies are not implied by delivery; a reply remains an explicit Relay
  action derived from a received delivery ID
- an integration can explicitly disable wake, but passive delivery remains enabled
  unless Relay itself is disabled

## Out of Scope

- restarting an exited agent process or resuming a dormant harness automatically
- launching or managing a parallel runtime/session as a substitute for the
  existing session addressed by the sender
- spawning agents, assigning work, or supervising completion
- sender-selected wake syntax or semantic wake decisions
- treating runtime admission as proof that the agent understood or used a message
- automatic agent conversations or unbounded reply chains
- Pallium deciding that another review or implementation pass should happen; the
  participating agent must explicitly send each handoff or reply

## Done When

1. A Relay send is persisted and wakes every eligible resolved recipient without a
   user turn or sender delivery flag.
2. Busy recipients process the message in a separate safe turn, never by accidental
   steering of an active human-owned turn.
3. Unsupported, unavailable, stale, or passive recipients receive the same durable
   message exactly once on their next natural turn.
4. Delivery state and dashboard telemetry distinguish wake attempt, runtime
   admission, fallback, and terminal expiry without claiming downstream use.
5. Full-lifecycle E2E coverage verifies the observable contract through each
   supported runtime's real integration surface.
6. Relay-triggered turns preserve attribution, lower-authority treatment, sandbox
   policy, and ordinary permission prompts.
7. Queue, duplicate, rate, and reply-hop bounds terminate replay or reply storms
   while leaving the original durable delivery diagnosable.

8. A live Claude Code developer → Codex architect → Claude Code remediation →
   Codex verdict journey completes after one initial user instruction and no
   intermediate user prompts. Repeat with the runtime roles reversed where the
   installed integrations support it.
9. That journey remains exact-once and model-visible when either recipient is
   idle or busy, and across a Pallium or recipient-integration restart. If wake
   cannot be admitted, the delivery remains durable and the dashboard/status
   exposes the fallback or actionable failure rather than silently stalling.

## Notes

Implementation plan: [wake-first Relay delivery](../../docs/plans/2026-08-26-wake-first-relay-delivery.md).

Phase 0 decision and installed-runtime evidence:
[Relay wake feasibility](../../docs/designs/016-relay-wake-feasibility.md).

Current result: Codex is passive-only because the managed experimental App Server
does not wake the existing addressed session and is rejected for Relay wake.
OpenCode and Claude Code remain candidates only through integrations that preserve
the identity of the user's already-running addressed session. None of these claims
changes passive next-turn fallback.
