## Summary

Make immediate activation the default for every resolved Relay recipient while
preserving durable next-turn delivery as the automatic fallback. The sender does
not choose a delivery mode: Pallium persists first, uses the recipient runtime's
native wake mechanism when safe, and otherwise leaves the delivery pending.

## Why

Relay does not remove manual coordination if the user must prompt an idle recipient
merely to discover its mail. Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode expose different
mechanisms for starting or queuing a turn, so Pallium needs small runtime-specific
adapters behind one observable delivery contract.

## Delivery Contract

1. Persist the message and immutable per-recipient deliveries before attempting
   activation.
2. For every resolved recipient, use its advertised wake capability by default;
   there is no sender-side `wake` option.
3. If idle, start a new turn. If busy, queue a distinct turn at the runtime's safe
   boundary; never steer Relay text into an active human-owned turn.
4. Mark the delivery complete only when the runtime confirms admission into the
   recipient context. A trigger request or transport acknowledgement is not enough.
5. If activation is unsupported, disabled, unavailable, stale, or fails, leave the
   same delivery pending for the existing next-natural-turn path.

Track activation separately from the durable delivery lifecycle. Operationally,
Pallium must distinguish `queued` (persisted, not activated), `triggered` (a runtime
turn was requested), and `delivered` (the runtime admitted the message). Never call
a message read, understood, or used. Stable message and delivery IDs must make wake
retries, runtime callbacks, and hook fallback idempotent.

## Runtime Feasibility and Constraints

Deeper source review on 2026-08-26 corrected the initial Phase 0 verdict. The
installed versions are Claude Code 2.1.246, Codex CLI 0.149.1, and OpenCode
1.18.19 on native Windows.

| Runtime | Current verdict | Proven mechanism | Remaining qualification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Codex | Supported with a Pallium-managed App Server; implement first | Experimental thread/queue/add durably queues a distinct future turn, auto-dispatches while idle, preserves clientUserMessageId, emits the exact ID/text in item/started, and survives cold thread resume in official integration tests. | Feature-detect the experimental API and prove the installed 0.149.1 Windows stdio path with a disposable App Server. This does not wake an arbitrary completed codex exec process or unmanaged TUI. |
| OpenCode | Supported with a Pallium/OpenCode plugin coordinator | Server/plugin APIs expose stable sessions and async prompts. Agent Intercom demonstrates persist-first delivery, application metadata correlation, history verification before replay, safe busy deferral, and restart recovery. | A bare prompt_async 204 is transport acknowledgement only. Pallium needs the plugin-owned durable pending ledger and a Windows E2E proof. |
| Claude Code | Version-eligible for native live-session wake; strict busy delivery still needs a policy/proof | Official cross-session messaging starts a new turn when idle and authenticates the local inbox socket on native Windows. Installed 2.1.246 exceeds the documented 2.1.234 Windows minimum. | During an active turn Claude reads messages between tool calls, which may not create a distinct following turn. Verify native Windows delivery/correlation and either defer busy messages until idle or explicitly relax the distinct-turn invariant. Managed claude -p --resume is only for Pallium-owned workers, not concurrent arbitrary TUIs. |

### Admission handshakes to preserve

**Codex:** initialize App Server with experimentalApi, add the Relay payload with
clientUserMessageId = pallium:<delivery_id>, treat the queue response as queued,
and mark admission only on item/started for a userMessage carrying the same client
ID and exact content. turn/completed is execution completion, not delivery. Never
use turn/steer; do not substitute turn/start for the busy queue.

**OpenCode:** the plugin persists the Relay item before broker acknowledgement,
checks recent session history for metadata.palliumRelayId, defers submission to a
safe boundary, calls the supported prompt API, and marks admission only when
session messages/events contain that exact ID. On restart it replays only items
not proven admitted. A server plugin can cover normal OpenCode sessions without
requiring every session to be launched by a Pallium wrapper.

**Claude Code:** register only a live inbox with its socket/token and current
inbound policy. Include the Pallium delivery ID in the attributed envelope and do
not equate socket acceptance with downstream use. Idle native delivery may wake
immediately. Busy delivery must not violate the separate-turn contract; use an
idle notification/deferred send if that can be proven, otherwise fall back to
next-turn Relay. A managed worker may serialize claude -p --resume under a
per-session lock, but that is a separate managed-session capability. Channels
remain a research-preview fallback, not the preferred local adapter.

Each live session advertises only capabilities its integration actually proves:
passive, idle_wake, and busy_queue. Missing, expired, disabled, or lost capability
selects durable fallback. Runtime names are never global capability claims, and an
exited arbitrary process is not wakeable merely because its conversation can be
resumed by launching another process.

### Next disposable PoC sequence

Start with Codex because it has the strongest first-party contract:

1. idle queue add auto-starts a distinct turn;
2. busy queue add remains separate until the active turn finishes;
3. clientUserMessageId and exact text appear in item/started;
4. a queued item survives App Server restart/cold thread resume;
5. duplicate use of one Relay ID admits exactly once;
6. unavailable/unsupported experimental API leaves the Pallium delivery pending.

Then implement the equivalent OpenCode plugin PoC. Test Claude native Windows
2.1.246 third, explicitly deciding the busy-turn semantic before enabling it.

## In Scope

- wake every eligible resolved recipient by default, including runtime fan-out
- allow a recipient integration to explicitly disable wake and remain passive
- persist before attempting wake; retain next-natural-turn delivery as fallback
- queue busy recipients for a separate safe turn rather than steering an active
  human-owned turn
- confirm runtime admission before marking delivery complete
- make trigger attempts idempotent so wake and fallback cannot double-deliver
- expose wake attempts, admission, fallback reasons, failures, latency, and fan-out
  in Relay operational telemetry
- implement and validate the smallest supported native adapter for Claude Code,
  Codex, and OpenCode
- cover idle, busy, concurrent user input, unsupported capability, stale or closed
  sessions, runtime and Pallium restarts, duplicate triggers, permissions, fan-out,
  expiry, and reply-loop protection through public-surface E2E tests

## Safety and Cost Boundary

Wake changes Relay from passive information transport into an execution trigger:
the receiving model can consume tokens, invoke tools, and modify files. Therefore:

- Relay input is attributed peer input with lower authority than user instructions;
  it cannot grant consent, approve permissions, change runtime configuration, or
  bypass the recipient's sandbox and approval policy
- runtime-wide fan-out still wakes every resolved recipient by default, but the
  resulting turn count, failures, and observable usage must be visible
- bounded queues, duplicate/rate limits, and a finite reply-hop policy must prevent
  accidental wake storms and autonomous reply loops
- automatic replies are not implied by delivery; a reply remains an explicit Relay
  action derived from a received delivery ID
- an integration can explicitly disable wake, but passive delivery remains enabled
  unless Relay itself is disabled

## Out of Scope

- restarting an exited agent process or resuming a dormant harness automatically
- spawning agents, assigning work, or supervising completion
- sender-selected wake syntax or semantic wake decisions
- treating runtime admission as proof that the agent understood or used a message
- automatic agent conversations or unbounded reply chains

## Done When

1. A Relay send is persisted and wakes every eligible resolved recipient without a
   user turn or sender delivery flag.
2. Busy recipients process the message in a separate safe turn, never by accidental
   steering of an active human-owned turn.
3. Unsupported, unavailable, stale, or passive recipients receive the same durable
   message exactly once on their next natural turn.
4. Delivery state and dashboard telemetry distinguish wake attempt, runtime
   admission, fallback, and terminal expiry without claiming downstream use.
5. Full-lifecycle E2E coverage verifies the observable contract through each
   supported runtime's real integration surface.
6. Relay-triggered turns preserve attribution, lower-authority treatment, sandbox
   policy, and ordinary permission prompts.
7. Queue, duplicate, rate, and reply-hop bounds terminate replay or reply storms
   while leaving the original durable delivery diagnosable.

## Notes

Implementation plan: [wake-first Relay delivery](../../docs/plans/2026-08-26-wake-first-relay-delivery.md).

Phase 0 decision and installed-runtime evidence:
[Relay wake feasibility](../../docs/designs/016-relay-wake-feasibility.md).

Current result: Codex's managed experimental App Server queue is the reference
contract and first implementation target. OpenCode is viable with a durable
plugin coordinator. Updated Claude Code 2.1.246 is eligible for native Windows
cross-session messaging, but its busy-turn semantics still require an explicit
decision and local proof. None of these claims changes passive next-turn fallback.
